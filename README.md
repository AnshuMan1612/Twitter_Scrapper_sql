    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="YourPassword"
)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script

python scraper.py

üóÑ Database Schema

Column Name	Data Type	Description

id	INT (Primary Key, Auto Increment)	Unique row identifier

user_name	VARCHAR(255)	Twitter handle of the user

bio	TEXT	User's bio from Twitter

location	VARCHAR(255)	User's location

website	VARCHAR(255)	User's website URL

join_date	VARCHAR(255)	The date user joined Twitter

following_count	INT	Number of accounts the user follow

followers_count	INT	Number of followers


üõ† How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ The script logs into Twitter using Selenium.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reads Twitter profile URLs from the CSV file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scrapes profile details using BeautifulSoup & Selenium.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Stores the extracted data into a MySQL database.


‚ùå Troubleshooting

Login Issues

Ensure your Twitter credentials are correct.

If login fails, Twitter might have changed its UI ‚Äì update the CSS selectors accordingly.

Scraper Stops Working

Twitter may block automated access.

Try reducing the scraping speed (time.sleep(5)).

Use rotating proxies or different accounts.

MySQL Errors

Ensure MySQL server is running and credentials are correct.

If the database is not created, manually create it using:

CREATE DATABASE twitter_scraper_db;
